# Tetris
Author: Tyler Ferry
Date: 3/15/2018
Purpose: A fun project I did in high school. Not perfect by any means but I learned a lot through this process
Included: Tetris.java, TetrisGUI.java, Pieces.java
  Each class has its own purpose, but the main idea behind three classes is to improve readability and have abstraction between classes
